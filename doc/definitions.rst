   pathname
   path
      A string, consisting of filenames separated with forward slashes.

      - `/foo/bar/baz`
      - `foo/bar`

   basename
      The part of a path after the last forward slash in it.  If the path ends
      in a forward slash, then the basename is the empty string.

   dirname
      The part of a path before the last forward slash in it.

   filename
      A string, which in a directory maps to a link.  Cannot contain forward
      slashes.

      - `foo`
      - `.bar`

   link
      A directory entry pointing to a file.  A hard link.

   file
      A file in the file system, consisting of its inode and corresponding data
      blocks.  A file has at least one link pointing to it.

   directory
      A special type of file, which maps filenames to links.

   symbolic link
   symlink
      A special type of link, which contains a string instead of pointing to a
      file.  The string is used as a pathname.

A pathname consists of filenames separated with forward slashes.  In a
directory, a filename may map to a link.  A link points to a file.  A file has
at least one link pointing to it.  A directory is a special file which can only
have one link pointing to it and maps filenames to links.

   tagname
      A special type of pathname which begins with at least two forward
      slashes.  After stripping all forward slashes from the beginning of a
      tagname, the remaining string is considered a pathname relative to a
      given rootpath.

   rootpath
      A pathname that is used to resolve a tagname.

   library
      A directory which contains a link to a directory with the filename
      `.dantalian`.

A file is tagged with a directory if and only if there exists at least one hard
link to the file in that directory.

A file A is tagged at a path B if and only if B refers to a link that
points to A.

A directory may contain a link to a file with the filename `.dtags`.  The file
to which this link points contains tagnames which are each terminated with a
single newline.

A directory is internally tagged with a tagname if and only if its `.dtags`
file contains that tagname.

A directory A is externally tagged at pathname B if and only if B refers to a
symlink that refers to A.

A directory A is externally tagged with a directory B if and only if there
exists at least one symlink in B that refers to A.

Given a rootpath, a directory A being internally tagged with a tagname B is
equivalent to A being externally tagged at the pathname which is equivalent
to B.

Dantalian uses both internal and external tags, but internal tags are
considered more stable and reliable than external tags.

Dantalian treats symlinks as a hard link to the file its target refers to,
except where Dantalian specifically operates on symlinks.  Broken symlinks are
treated as regular files, except where Dantalian specifically operates on
broken symlinks.

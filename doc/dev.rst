Developer Guide
===============

Welcome to dantalian's Developer Guide!  If you're looking to build an
application using dantalian, contribute, or just tinker with the code,
take this with you.  Also, if you're a user who is just curious about
the design or abstractions behind dantalian, a quick peek won't hurt.

Remember that the source code is the 100% canonical documentation, so if
there's a bug in the code that's not documented here, the code wins =).

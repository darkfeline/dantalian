Developers Guide
================

Welcome to dantalian's Developers Guide!  If you're looking to build an
application using dantalian, contribute, or just tinker with the code,
take this with you.  Also, if you're curious about the design or
abstractions behind dantalian, a quick peek won't hurt.

Remember that the source code is the 100% canonical documentation, so if
there's a bug in the code that's not documented here, the code wins =).

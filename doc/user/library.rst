Libraries
=========

Libraries are the fundamental level of abstraction in dantalian.  A
library is an abstract tag-based file organization system layered
transparently on top of the underlying file system using hard links.
Libraries are created on directories, which become the root for its
library.  A special ``.dantalian`` directory is created in the root
directory.

.. warning::
   I've said it before, but it bears repeating: dantalian uses hard
   links heavily.  Make sure you are familiar with how hard links work!
   They are very powerful, but can be messy and/or dangerous if you are
   not familiar with them.  Especially take care not to accidently break
   hard links, e.g. by copying and removing files.  dantalian leverages
   the advantages hard links provide, but won't protect you from
   yourself!

Tags are directories, and all directories are potential tags (except
``.dantalian``, a special directory)  Files are "tagged" by creating a
hard link in the respective directory.  Files can have any number and
combination of tags.  File names and tag names are restricted only by
the underlying file system (on ext4, for example, up to 255 bytes
and all characters except ``/`` are allowed, so knock yourself out).
All files of all types can be tagged, including symlinks.  dantalian
provides functionality such that even directories can be tagged, perfect
for hardcore file organizers.

Usage
-----

While it is possible to manage the library abstraction solely using
standard programs such as ``ln``, ``mv``, etc., dantalian provides
useful scripts for performing operations such as tagging, untagging, and
deleting, as commands for the command-line script ``dantalian``.

See the :doc:`manpage </manpage>` for the commands for ``dantalian``.

Specific Requirements
---------------------

There are some requirements for libraries:

#) The root directory must be located on a POSIX filesystem that
   supports hard links (e.g., ``ext4``).
#) Everything under the root directory must be on one file system.
#) Do funky things with device mounts at your own risk.  This includes
   mounting another device inside a library, mounting a different
   library FUSE (more on this in :ref:`fuse`) in a library, and mounting
   the same library FUSE in itself.  Don't do it.

While the above may seem complicated, for most users, it should not be a
problem.  If you run into the above situations, chances are, you're an
advanced enough user to figure out why and how to fix them.

.. _name_conflicts:

Name conflicts
--------------

Files are hard linked under the tags that it possesses.  The file may
have different names in each of the directories, e.g. to avoid name
conflicts.  dantalian provides "partial" support for files having
different names.  The library abstraction is completely sound in this
case, but certain features may not work, or may be less useful or harder
to work with.  dantalian finds files by the path to one of its hard
links and manages them internally by hard link references and inodes.

Currently, dantalian is unable to tag a file if a file with the same
name exists in that location (this feature will be implemented later).
However, you can manually hard link the file with a different name and
dantalian will work perfectly.

See :ref:`names` for more information.

Tagging Directories
-------------------

Directories generally are not allowed to be hard linked in most file
systems, for various reasons.  However, symbolic links are regular files
and thus can be hard linked, even if they point to a directory.
dantalian leverages this, but care should be taken.

dantalian can convert directories.  Converting a directory moves it to a
special location under ``.dantalian`` and replaces it with an absolute
symbolic link to its new location.  This allows directories to be tagged
just like other files.

This feature imposes an extra requirement on the library root directory.
Namely, when the root directory path is changed, the symbolic links of
all converted directories must be fixed by running ``dantalian fix``.
Also, unlike regular files, which can be freely hard linked to
directories outside of the library (and tagged in other libraries), if
you hard link the symbolic link of a dantalian-converted directory
outside of it, move the library, and run ``dantalian fix``, it will
break the external hard links.  If this is one of your use cases, place
the directories in a fixed location outside of the library, create a
symlink, and then tag it with dantalian instead of using ``dantalian
convert``.  ``dantalian convert`` is best used for tagging tags; you
*can* use it for tagging directories (e.g., scanned books, entire albums
as a single unit), but if you forsee moving the library and hard linking
the symlinks elsewhere, use the method mentioned above.

Because converted directories are all kept in one location, no two
converted directories may have the same name.  However, the name of the
directory dantalian keeps track of and the name of the symbolic link
that users will be interacting with are separate.  Thus, if there's a
naming conflict, the actual directory can be renamed, and the symbolic
links follow the naming rules as above.

Moving Libraries
----------------

Since libraries are simply directories, moving and/or backing up
libraries is very simple.  There are two thing to keep in mind:  use
``rsync -H`` to preserve hard links, and don't forget to run ``dantalian
fix`` to fix absolute symbolic links for converted directories.  The
latter is extremely important as dantalian currently will *not* check if
it needs fixing, so you may potentially break your library.

Nested Libraries
----------------

Only one library can exist in any given directory, but libraries can be
nested.  Behavior is well-defined, but I wouldn't recommend it unless
you have a clear use case and know what you are doing.  ``dantalian``
works with a single library for its operations.  Usually, it will search
up through the directories and use the first library it finds, so take
care where you run it.  You can also specify a specific library by
using the ``--root`` option.  In fact, if you are nesting libraries, it
is recommended to *always* use ``--root``.

Scalability
-----------

dantalian's scalability ultimately depends on the host file system, but
is generally pretty lenient.  On ext4, for example, the main limiting
factor is number of files per directory, i.e., the number of files that
have a given tag.  dantalian remains usable no matter the number, but if
you have, say, more than 10,000 files with a given tag, ``ls``
(specifically ``readdir()`` on the kernel level) may begin to see
performance issues.  However, file access will not be affected.

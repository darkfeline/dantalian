Introduction
============

Dantalian is a Python 3 library that provides convenient functions for file
organization and tagging using hard links.

Dantalian is extremely flexible, imposing no constraints on usage; read the
documentation carefully so you understand what you are doing.

Dantalian can also be used as a standalone program.  However, using Dantalian
separately may be slow due to Python's nature.  When performing bulk
operations, consider using Dantalian as a library in a Python script instead of
invoking Dantalian repeatedly in a shell script.

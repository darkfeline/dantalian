Tags
====

Tags can be specified as absolute or relative.

Absolute tags start with ``/``, like absolute paths.  They describe a
tag/directory relative to the library root.

Relative tags do not start with ``/``.  They describe a tag/directory
relative to the current working directory.  Directories not under the
library root are not valid tags for that library.

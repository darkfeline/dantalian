.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdantalian\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]... \fICOMMAND\fP [\fIARGS\fP]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBdantalian\fP is the command line utility for dantalian, a transparent
tag\-based file organization system.
.sp
Comprehensive documentation can be found online at
\fI\%https://dantalian.readthedocs.org/\fP (note which version of dantalian the
documentation is for).  The documentation may also be distributed and
installed locally, in which case it can probably be found in the usual
location.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-root \fIROOT\fP
Specify a specific library to use.
.TP
.B \-\-loglevel \fILEVEL\fP
Show only logged messages LEVEL and below.  Can be DEBUG, INFO, WARN,
ERROR, or CRITICAL, case insensitive.
.TP
.B \-\-logfile \fIFILE\fP
Specify a file to log to instead of stderr.
.TP
.B \-\-logfilter \fIMODULE\fP
Show only messages from the given module
.UNINDENT
.sp
The last three options are for debugging purposes.  If you run into a
bug, run \fBdantalian\fP with \fB\-\-loglevel=DEBUG \-\-logfile=output.log\fP
and include the log with the bug report.
.SH COMMANDS
.sp
There are three types of commands: universal, library, and fuse.
Universal commands are used without a reference to a library.  Library
commands must be used with a library (either detected automatically or
specified with \fB\-\-root\fP.  Fuse commands must be used with a
fuse\-mounted library.
.SS UNIVERSAL
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B init
Usage: \fBdantalian init\fP [\fIDIR\fP]
.sp
Creates a library in DIR.  If DIR is omitted, creates a library in
the current directory.
.UNINDENT
.SS LIBRARY
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B tag
Usage: \fBdantalian tag\fP \fITAG\fP \fIFILE\fP...
.sp
Tags FILE with TAG.  If FILE is already tagged, does nothing.  If
FILE is a directory, you\(aqll need to convert it first.  The option
\fB\-s\fP reverses \fITAG\fP and \fIFILE\fP, for tagging a single file with
multiple tags.
.TP
.B untag
Usage: \fBdantalian untag\fP \fITAG\fP \fIFILE\fP...
.sp
Removes TAG from FILE.  If FILE isn\(aqt tagged, does nothing.  Has the
same \fB\-s\fP options as \fBtag\fP
.TP
.B tags
Usage: \fBdantalian tags\fP \fIFILE\fP
.sp
Lists all the tags of FILE.
.TP
.B find
Usage: \fBdantalian find\fP \fITAG\fP...
.sp
Intersection tag search.  Lists all files that have all of the given
tags.  Lists files by the path to the hard link under the first tag
given.
.TP
.B rm
Usage: \fBdantalian rm\fP \fIFILE\fP...
.sp
Removes the files given.  That is, removes all hard links to the
given files in the library.  Hard links outside of the library are
unaffected.
.TP
.B rename
Usage: \fBdantalian rename\fP \fIFILE\fP \fINEW\fP
.sp
Renames all hard links of FILE to NEW.
.TP
.B convert
Usage: \fBdantalian convert\fP \fIDIR\fP...
.sp
Converts directories so they can be tagged.  (Moves directories to
special location \(aq.dantalian/dirs\(aq and replaces the original with a
symlink pointing to the absolute path).
.TP
.B fix
Usage: \fBdantalian fix\fP
.sp
Fixes symlinks after the library has been moved.  If it hasn\(aqt been
moved, does nothing.
.TP
.B clean
Usage: \fBdantalian clean\fP
.sp
Clean converted directories.  Delete any converted directories which
no longer have any symlinks in the library reference it.

"""This package contains library operations for directory tagging.

These are split into two modules, for things that handle internal and external
tags, respectively.

Specification
-------------

A directory may contain a link to a file with the filename `.dtags`.  The file
to which this link points contains tagnames which are each terminated with a
single newline.

A directory is internally tagged with a tagname if and only if its `.dtags`
file contains that tagname.

A directory A is externally tagged with a directory B if and only if there
exists at least one symlink in B that refers to A.

A directory A is externally tagged at pathname B if and only if B refers to a
symlink that refers to A.

Given a rootpath, a directory A being internally tagged with a tagname B is
equivalent to A being externally tagged at the pathname which is equivalent
to B.

Dantalian uses both internal and external tags, but internal tags are
considered more stable and reliable than external tags.

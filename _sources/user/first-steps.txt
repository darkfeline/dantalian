What is dantalian?
------------------

**What is dantalian?**

dantalian is a multi-dimensionally hierarchical tag-based file
organization system.

**A short description in English please.**

Sorry, I'll have to use a few diagrams too.  Say I love listening to
music and I have a bunch of music on my hard drive.  A common way to
organize music is like this::

   Genre/
      Artist/
         Album/
            song

The problem is, I have this song that's a single.  No problem, I can
just do this::

   Genre/
      Artist/
         single

But what if it's a collab between two different artists?  Or if the song
mixes genres?  Or if I like my songs grouped by where I listen to them
(in the car, at home, at work)?  I'm screwed, that's what.

A multi-dimensional hierarchy means that I can do this::

   Genres/
      Anime/
         traumerei.mp3
      Rock/
         traumerei.mp3
   Artists/
      Haruka Tomatsu/
         traumerei.mp3
         Gen'ei OP/
            traumerei.mp3
   Albums/
      Gen'ei OP/
         traumerei.mp3
      Anison Collection/
         traumerei.mp3
   Anime/
      Series/
         Gen'ei wo Kakeru Taiyou/
            Gen'ei OP/
               traumerei.mp3
   Rating/
      5/
         traumerei.mp3
      4/
      3/
      2/
      1/

**Wait, that looks like a pain to manage.  And you have like ten copies
of one song, doesn't that waste space?**

Actually, thanks to the magic of hard links, there's only one copy of
``traumerei.mp3``.  It takes up the space of one copy, and if you change
the song in any of the places it appears, all of them change.  They're
all the same file.  Don't worry, dantalian makes managing this easy as
pie.

**Oh okay.  Wait, doesn't that look like metadata tags on .mp3 files?**

That's the tag-based part.  Normally, if you wanted to search for a song
with a tag, you'd have to open up a music manager like amaroK or iTunes.
With dantalian, if you want to find all songs tagged with the ``Pop``
genre, you just go to the folder ``Genres/Pop`` and all the files are
there.

**Cool.  What about multi-tag searches and such?**

dantalian can do that do, but that's a slightly more advanced feature
for a little later.

**So what can I use dantalian for?**

Everything.  All files, and even folders as well.  You can then organize
them however you want.  Knock yourself out.

**Holy cow, I will, thanks.  So how do I get started?**

Install dantalian (See :ref:`install`).  No further setup necessary.

Using dantalian
---------------

**Er, how do I use this thing?**

Let's run through an example.  Say you have a single song in your
``Music`` folder and want to organize it (hey, it's an example).

We start by making a library::

   $ mkdir library
   $ dantalian init library

Or you can do::

   $ mkdir library
   $ cd library
   $ dantalian init

Right now our directories look like this::

   Music/
      song.mp3
   library/

Let's make a bunch of directories for how we want to organize our song::

   library/
      Genres/
         Rock/
      Artists/
         Bob/
         Charlie/
      Albums/
         B&C's First Album/

Dantalian v1.0 is now released.  The old version of Dantalian is now on the
v0.6 branch, with an accompanying v0.6.1 fast-forward update release.

v0.6 will most likely only be reserved for bugfixes, as development moves
forward with the current master branch, from v1.0 onward.

v1.0 marks the stabilization of the API and a lot of feature cuts for the sake
of progress.

title: v1.0 migration

v1.0 completely changes how directories are linked/tagged, requiring a
migration from previous versions.

In a previous post, I posted a short migration notice; ignore that and use this
instead.  You may/it is recommended that you wait until v1.0 is officially
released before migrating.

v1.0 directory linking is strictly a superset of the earlier implementation, so
migration is fairly painless.

1. Make sure your library's symlinks are correct (Run `dantalian fix` with the
   old version if you have moved it).
2. Upgrade Dantalian to v1.0.
3. In the root directory of your library, run:

        $ dantalian save --all .dantalian
        $ dantalian unload --all .dantalian
        $ mv .dantalian/dirs storage
        $ dantalian load --all .dantalian

    This will move the stored directories to the `storage` directory.  You can
    then remove it if you want; the stored directories will be intelligently
    relocated:

        $ dantalian unlink storage/*
        $ rmdir storage
